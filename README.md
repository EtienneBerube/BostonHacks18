# BostonHacks18

This IoT project would allow users to rent and unlock a home straight from the web app. This project was built with an Angular 6 Frontend, a Java Springboot Backend and uses an Arduino to control the smartlock. From the web app, the user sees a selection of rooms to rent on a map, selects one and then is prompted to enter a code that the user will see on the lock.

This project was built for the BostonHacks 2018 Fall Hackathon.
